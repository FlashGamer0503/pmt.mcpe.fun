    <h4>Where do I start?</h4>
    <p>This website has many tools such as ZIP Converting, PHAR Converting and API Modification. These tools are avalible for
        you to use free at charge. That means you will not need to install DevTools when you want to convert a plugin. The
        best place to start is to use the PHAR Compiler to make your plugins compact. You can click on one of the left links
        to begin.</p>
    <h4>Will this always be availble?</h4>
    <p>More than likely this website will always be avalible, this site takes time and money to host. We will keep going as
        long as our users are liking what we do and we are getting income. This is open-source so when/if we die you can
        carry it on!</p>
